Hello thereï¼ŒIf you guys are wondering why it shows error when you upload the code to your board. 
There are many ways to troubleshoot it!


1. Try to see if you chose the right board at the board menu.
2. First upload the code to your board, then finish your circuit.
3. Make sure you have the Arduino Playtune Library in your software!
4. Try uploading again if the code failed to compile
5. make sure you didn't change any preloaded code.

 that's all i can help! Forgot to mention that my code can work on Beta Version too~ so Enjoy ~ <3<3
